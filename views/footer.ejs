                            To read more about the project, visit the README.md file. For our project we created a few different
                            clicking tests. The first is clicks per second to see how many clicks the user can do in 10 seconds. The second is
                            a reaction time test. There will be three buttons that pop up with only one of them being green. This score will be determined by
                            how fast the user can get 5 correct. Finally the last test is a mouse accuracy test. Buttons will pop up randomly on the screen in different locations
                            and the user must move their cursor to press 5 of them. We also have a leaderboard page as well to see logged in users best scores.
