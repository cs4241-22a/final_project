**Specifications** 
We are going to create a game featuring a log in system and a leaderboard. 
The highest game score per user will be stored on the user account and on a global leaderboard. 
The game itself will be completely clientside, with the scores being sent to a mongDB instance at the end of the game. 
We are going to create a 2D platforming game where the objective is for your player sprite to get from point A to point B 
There will be collision obstacles. You get timed and score is based on time. 

Key technologies:
MongoDB - Store user info & leaderboard
Express - For backend 
Authentication for login - An authentication library or with cookies
Mongoose for mongoDB - easier interaction with database
NodeJS - for obvious reasons
Game engine (in JS) to create game - experimenting with game engines and game design
