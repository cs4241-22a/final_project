# Gompei Clicker v2 
**In Brief**: Our project will be a “Cookie Clicker”-esque game, but with Gompei as the object to be clicked. As you click Gompei you will gain “goat bucks” for each click. You can purchase ‘upgrades’ to automate or improve your clicking. You will login via Github OAuth and your upgrades and scores will be saved. There will be a global scoreboard for all players to see who is the best Gompei Clicker out there. The game will include a playlist soundtrack.



**Key Technologies**:
	- MonogoDB
	- Express
	- Github OAuth
	- React or ESJ
	- Bootstrap as CSS framework
	- Favicon
