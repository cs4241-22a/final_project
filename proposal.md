### App overview:

This app will be a scheduling tool that will allow users to create tasks/events in both a list view and calendar view. A task will have several options/fields associated with it, namely a title, description, date, time, duration, and colors/tags. Additionally, we plan on having users login via GitHub OAuth, and a stretch goal will be to allow users to share their schedules with other users who can choose to view it.

We plan on using node.js and express for the server, as well as React, Passport.js, Svelte, and mongoDB. We will also select a CSS framework to ensure a cohesive style (we have yet to determine the specific framework).
