Final Project Idea:

Play chess against StockFish. The WebApp will host a chessboard where the user plays a game against a computer. Game state will be saved to the user's account. The backend receives the position from the from end, then provides back the best move according to the engine. 

Technologies:
- Express
- We are thinking about using react, not sure yet.
- MongoDB


Some thing that we might include:
- Difficulty slider
- Game Replays
- Save previous games
