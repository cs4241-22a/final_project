We propose to make a collaborative playlist application. 
In this application users can create playlists that are public to everyone, or add songs to existing playlists. 
Adding a song to a public playlist adds that song to a “queue” where the song must get enough upvotes in order to be added to the playlist. 
A song that receives too many downvotes is removed from the playlist or queue.

Our target users will be music enthusiasts who enjoy finding new music and like to share their music.

We plan to use Glitch so that we can all contribute to a project together, as well as Node.js and Mongodb for basic functionality and data storage.
We plan to use javascript for the client, and Bootstrap for css.

Optional ideas if we have additional time include: 
adding a comments section,
having top charts that show playlists with the most upvotes,
QR code for each playlist, 
and other ideas.
