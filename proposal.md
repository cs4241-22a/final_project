### General Description
**youFree?** is a better when2meet. Our goal with this application is to allow users to create youFree? accounts that sync with their Outlook Calendar. Users could either start with a blank schedule or auto-fill their current calendar availability. From there, users could edit their availability grid as they see fit. We also plan to add more nuanced availability options such as yes, no, and maybe.

Once peopleâ€™s schedules are inputted, the event creator would be able to select a proposed time. This would trigger an Outlook Calendar invite to be sent, which participants can decline or accept, automatically adding it to their calendar. The application would keep track of which youFree? events users have created or been invited to. This feature would make it easier for users to keep track of their meetings and prevent double booking. Event creators would have the option to remind participants to fill out the youFree? event if they have not already done so.
