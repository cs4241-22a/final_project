The group members are Gabriel Buonomano, May Dong, Patrick Salisbury, and Grace Yue. We want to create a cookbook-type web app. The app will consist of a login page, a registration page, and a "feed" page that displays all posted recipes. 

Recipes consist of a title, an optional description, an ingredients list, instructions, an optional image, and date posted. The feed sorts recipes by most recently posted, but other sorting options will be possible (alphabetically, chronologically).

Users will be able to search for recipes by keyword, including the name of the recipe & ingredients required. In addition, logged-in users will be able to add, update, and delete their own recipes, but users do not need to be logged in to simply view and query recipes.

We will develop this application using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, and possibly some Redux and Bootstrap for styling. Depending on the needs of the project, we might also look into using frameworks designed specifically for blogs and dynamic-content websites.
