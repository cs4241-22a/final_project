## Description
Pet the .jpeg is an interactive web application where users raise their own pet. Users level up their pet by repeatedly clicking it. As the pet’s level increases, it becomes more challenging to continue to level up by requiring more clicks to do so. By leveling up, the pet unlocks new attributes that can be customized to change its visual appearance. Customizations include hats, colors, and different pet species. The progress of users is saved on a database, so they can continue their progress the next time they log in. There are two main pages: the log-in page and the pet interaction page.

Technologies and libraries that are to be used include Express, MongoDB, and React. Express will be used for its middleware and to handle server requests, MongoDB will be used to store user authentication data along with user pet data, and React will be used to manage client-side functionality.
