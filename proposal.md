The goal is to create a social song recommendation app with three main functions:
  - Making posts asking for song recommendations
  - Responding to posts with a song recommendation
  - Viewing all recommendations on a post

By logging in, users can put their usernames on a post and see how many suggestions they've made in total. There's a lot of potential here for adding features, but the three main functions should be achievable by the due date.

This team consists of Theo Coppola, Gabi Tessier, Jack McEvoy, Griffin Atchue. We will use Svelte, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. We could potentially use OAuth with Spotify for logins.

Potential Features:
  - Ranking posts and ranking suggestions on a post
  - Viewing all past posts for a user
  - Generate spotify playlist based on suggestions (If using Spotify Authentication)
  - Change order in which posts are displayed
  - Dynamically adding posts to the page based on the viewport
