#Webware Final Project Proposal#

##Group Members: Joseph Dobbelaar, Megan Letendre, Tobias Mack, Dillon McCarthy, Kseniia Romanova##

  Regardless of whether you live alone, with roommates, or your family, every person wants a say in what food is purchased for the week. The traditional method of a simple grocery list has been effective so far, however it can definitely be improved. Traditional grocery lists can be disorganized making it easier to forget items, the list itself can be easily forgotten, and it can be difficult to make sure every person in the home gets to provide their input.

  Our group came up with an idea to help improve some of these pain points: Go Grocery. 

  Go Grocery is an application that allows users to create a “group list” by creating a group account. As the week progresses, users can contribute to the grocery list by adding items they want or need as they think of them. As the users add these groceries, the application will categorize them based on common grocery store sections (i.e., deli section). When a user goes grocery shopping, they will have an organized and comprehensive list available to them. As they shop, items can be crossed off and removed. Once the trip is over, the list is reset and ready for users to add items for the next shopping trip. Overall, this application will create a more enjoyable, comprehensive, and convenient grocery shopping experience for all members in the household.

  To achieve development of this application, we will first execute a very shortened design thinking process. This process will include prototyping, user testing, and ideation on the designs based on the results of user testing. Then, we will use those designs as a model for development. The technology we will use during development are as follows: 

1. Visual Studio Code for code editing
2. Github for code collaboration
3. Figma to build UI mockups
4. Google Fonts
5. Material.io Color to create a color scheme
6. MongoDB Cloud for managing our database
7. Express.js for building our web server
8. React for building our web client
9. Bootstrap CSS
10. Jest for testing our React application
11. Glitch for hosting our web application

  Upon entering our web application, the user will be greeted with a login page prompting for a username and a password. There will be two buttons also present: one for submitting login information and the other for creating a new user. When the user logs in, they will be taken to the main page containing the grocery list and actions they can do pertaining to the list.
