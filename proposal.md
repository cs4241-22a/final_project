# Final Project Proposal

By: Jacob Adams, Michael Emerson, Nathan Pollock

## Overview

For our final project we are going to recreate the WPI course reports site. As it stands the current course reports site, is clunky, and slow to use. There is no way to search for courses or professors, relevant information is scattered all around the page, and the UI itself is not very pleasing to the eye. We aim to fix all of these issues with our own site.

## The How

Our site will be leveraging SvelteKit in combination with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI on the front end and a NodeJS backend connected to a PlanetScale, MySQL database to hold the course reports data. We will also be implementing Microsoft SSO as our login mechanism to ensure only WPI students and faculty have access to this resource.

### *Sidenote*

*We already have pulled all of the course reports data and have it stored locally, so this not a concern for this project.*
