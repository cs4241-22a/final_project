1. A brief description of what you created, and a link to the project itself (two paragraphs of text)

We have created a text-based RPG with a login feature that stores user data. The game itself features random encounters, combat, and a shop, and character upgrades.  

2. Any additional instructions that might be needed to fully use your project (login information etc.)

Sample email to login:
email: joemama@gmail.com 
password : 123

(Can type in random email and password, and it will create an account)

4. An outline of the technologies you used and how you used them.

MongoDB - storing user login and player stats
Bcrypt - encrypting passwords
Body-parser - parsing json
cookie parser - parsing cookies
dotenv - storing environment variables
express - backend server
express session - managing/storing sessions
mongoose - creating MongoDB schemas

Challenging part of implementation - storing user session and progress in the database

6. What challenges you faced in completing the project.

Writing asynchronous requests and having the UI update correctly based on responses from the backend server
Using closures to dynamically generate buttons to create a turn-based game that relies on user-input. 

8. What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.
Brainstorming - all

Caleb - setup database, backend routes, combat and shop front-end logic, procedural enemy generation back-end logic
Joe - worked on the basics of the shop function with get item, and gave helping tips to others on their parts
Kaley - front end html and css (game screen)
Kate - front end html and css (login and character select)

10. A link to your project video.

Think of 1,3, and 4 in particular in a similar vein to the design / tech achievements for A1—A4… make a case for why what you did was challenging and why your implementation deserves a grade of 100%.
