README

1. A brief description of what you created, and a link to the project itself (two paragraphs of text)
  
  Link: https://final-project-lnbsr.glitch.me/ 
  
  Description: We created a website on which a user can login and view playlists of the top songs of various genres. They can also add songs to each genre, as well as upvote or downvote individual songs. Users can register, and the songs/votes data is persistent between sessions and users.

2. Any additional instructions that might be needed to fully use your project (login information etc.)
  
  Additional Instructions: The project is rather user-friendly. To Register, click the register button to go to the register page, enter your new username and password, and click register again. To sign in, click Sign In, enter your username and password, and click Sign In again. Once signed in, you can view the playlists of songs, and can upvote/downvote songs, as well as click the Add Song button to add a new song to its respective playlist.

3. An outline of the technologies you used and how you used them.
  We used MongoDB for a database, as well as bootstrap for CSS. We also used express for server-frontend communication. We also used Node.js for the server.

4. What challenges you faced in completing the project.

  Lexie and Benjamin ran into a number of errors redirecting from the login to the top page. Sidney and Nadiyah ran into some issues finding a good way of showing all the playlists on the same page, as well as showing the songs in tables rather than lists. Ryan ran into some issues getting server communication to work with her page.

5. What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.
  
  Benjamin took the lead on creating the server side code and communication with the database. Lexie did the Login page. Sidney and Nadiyah made the Top Songs page. Ryan created the Add Songs page.

6. A link to your project video.
