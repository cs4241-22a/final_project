#Interactive Climbing Gym Map

For this project, we created an interactive climbing gym map to display where climbs exist in a gym. Currently, most climbing gyms have no indication of where certain grades are located in a gym, leaving a climber to wander around looking for climbs they would like to try. With our program, route setters can add climbs to the database with the admin page, and climbers can easily find the climbs they want to try with a multitude of actions. Hovering over sections  as well as utilizing filters can be used to locate climbs, allowing the user to find the type of climb they would like to try, as well as the grade.

This program is intended for use for Central Rock Gym in Worcester, where we both climb regularly. By combining the different techniques we have learned in class, we have created a robust, visually appealing, and useful program that allows us to see the climbs. In the future, we plan on expanding this project and potentially working with CRG to implement it into their gym ecosystem.

There should be no additional information needed, other than a basic knowledge of climbing, which can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing. 

We used the following technologies:
- Bootstrap - a CSS framework to make the app visually appealing
- Node.js - for managing the server
- d3 - for displaying the map
- Express - for server management
- mongoDB - for persistent data storage

We faced relatively few challenges (other than time from other class schedules), however some included, hosting the server, sorting data, needing to manually write down all the climbs in the gym (yes, it is accurate to CRG right now, if you have not been, we recommend visting!).

Travis - Server hosting, d3 visualization and svg creation, mongoDB setup.
Colby - HTML base, Javascript logic, and CSS styling, ideation, README.
Both - we worked together often to help eachother through the struggles we had along the way, and played to our strengths when one of us was not familiar with a technology that the other was.

We really enjoyed this project and wish we had more time to work on it and make it better.
