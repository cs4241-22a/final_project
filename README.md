1. Aim Trainer Game with a Login Page, Create an Account Page, Leaderboard Page and Game page. The goal of the game
   is to click the green buttons that appear on the screen as fast as you can. Each user's high score will automatically
   be entered on the leaderboard. Users will be notified when they beat their own high score.
2. Instructions: Create an account and/or proceed to log in. This will take you to the game page, where you can attempt to get a good score on the Aim Trainer. Initiate the game by pressing the Start Game button. At any point, check the leaderboard to see how you are doing versus the other users.
3. Express, MongoDB, argon2, dotenv, ejs, jsonwebtoken, mongoose
4. Challenges included using timeout and time based events in the game including starting and stopping the game. Another challenge included getting the targets to appear randomly in the container, which is 95% functional, but targets clip once in a while. User authentication was much easier this time after practice in hw3 & 4
5. Aidan Mulcahey - Login, Create an Account, Leaderboard Page, & Design, Gabriel Camacho - created game and set up routes for backend, Jonathan Palmieri - wrote server code to connect and communicate with database
