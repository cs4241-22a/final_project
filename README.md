# Final Project
*Due October 13th (final day of the term)*

For your final project, you'll implement a web application that exhibits understanding of the course materials. 
This project should provide an opportunity to both be creative and to pursue individual research and learning goals.


1. A brief description of what you created, and a link to the project itself (two paragraphs of text)
2. Any additional instructions that might be needed to fully use your project (login information etc.)
3. An outline of the technologies you used and how you used them.
4. What challenges you faced in completing the project.
5. What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.
6. A link to your project video.

Think of 1,3, and 4 in particular in a similar vein to the design / tech achievements for A1—A4… make a case for why what you did was challenging and why your implementation deserves a grade of 100%.

# Final Project - Publify

(1/2) I created web application called "Publify" which is a web platform where you can create account and share your stories/knowledge/achievements and anything else that you want. The navigation is pretty straightforward - you can read posts even without logging in, but in case if you want to share your own post or write comments you would have to either log in or register a new account. When you published your post you can edit it anytime. For any story you can add image called preview, that will be seen by everyone on the home page.

(3) Technologies that I used:

### Back-end:

-express: to create server-side of the application

-mongoose: to connect MongoDB

-multer: to handle all image uploading to the server

-express-validator: to handle all form validations on server

-cors: to resolve issue with cross-origin resource sharing

-jsonwebtoken: to verify tokens, so that server knows that user is still loged in. (when you log in or register you get this token)

-bcrypt: to encrypt/decrypt all passwords.

### Front-end:

-React: I felt that react is the best open-source JS library that I could use for this project since I have strong knowledge of this technology

-axios: used it to handle all http requests to server from client-side.

-react-redux: used it to work with React's component model especially for http requests made from axios

-mui: used it to create UI of the project

-emotion.js: used it for writing css styles with JavaScript

-sass: used it to create css code much easier


(4) The only challenge that I faced during this project is lack of time. Since I was working on it by myself it was challenging to finish it by myself in a short time period. This term was one of the most challenging ones for me due to several reasons.

(5) As mentioned above I've finished this project by myself.
