Final Project Proposal: Raccoon-it 

For our final project, we will be creating a web app that allows users to generate raccoon memes with edit, comment, and rate functionalities. Our app provides users with a fun and entertaining outlet to interact with popular raccoon memes found across the internet currently. 
Users will be able to upload an image, add a caption, download or share the meme in a social media platform. Users will be able to rate each other's memes using an upvote or downvote rating system. The cumulative average of all user’s ratings will be shown on the corresponding meme. The web app will sort memes based on rating average on the front page, with the highest rated memes being featured at the top of the front page of the social media platform. We will model some features of our app off of Reddit.
 We will use MongoDB to handle database management, hosting the images, user data, and ratings for each meme. When a user rates a meme, the score will be updated in the corresponding MongoDB document. Once the meme is posted to the social media platform, the order of the memes will be updated showing the highest rated items first. Express will be used to handle encryption and server/client communication. 
We will use ReactJS to handle the front-end of our web app. React has the most online documentation and seems the best fit for our use cases. To design the user interface prior to development with ReactJS, we will create a prototype for our app in Figma. This will aid in improving the user flow and interface design of our app for a better user experience. After designing a prototype, we will develop the user interface using Bootstrap in combination with ReactJS. Based on research, Bootstrap components and classes seem very compatible with the ReactJS framework.
The purpose of our web app is to rate and comment on raccoon memes created by users. Memes are an integral aspect of our global community, as it aids in the culture and communication exchange in our modern world. The point of the app is to bring a community of raccoon memes together. It is a safe space that engenders the creativity of its users. Memes bring together users of all genders, races and backgrounds, and unite us. Our website is an ethical platform that does not sell the souls of its users (cough cough, Facebook). Not only can our app be used by anyone (any time, any place) but it also updates in real-time. You can also edit and delete your raccoon memes as you see fit or just keep creating more!

The technologies/libraries we will use to complete the project are the following:
MongoDB
ReactJS
Bootstrap 
Express middleware packages:
Body-parser
Passport
Express-session
Serve-favicon
