# GoataShop
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As STEM students, we often use applications to buy/sell/trade second-hand goods. Currently, there exists a Facebook Private Group called “WPI Students: Wanted/For Sale/Trade” with over 3000 members to support such needs of the community. However, we thought that having a WPI student-driven application would be beneficial for safety and data protection reasons. Besides the private group, there is also Facebook Marketplace and eBay, however, they are not community focused and we would like to have a platform built with trust. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motivated us to create GoataShop, a WPI-accessible shopping web application that can be used as a marketplace to sell or buy products. It will have features including login authentication, database storage of items currently being sold, and the ability to add items to your own cart. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user will be first welcomed with a login page. We are planning to use Outlook Authentication so that it is exclusive to the WPI community. Once logged in, you will be brought to your profile where you can add items you would like to sell. There will also be a complete list of items being sold. After showing interest in items stored in your cart, you will be connected with the seller via email to settle a price and or meeting spot. Once the item has been sold, it will be removed from the complete database of items along with other people's databases.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be using the following technologies:
* Client-side programming using React
* Server-side programming using Node.js (Express)
* Bootstrap for CSS Framework
* MongoDB
  * A Products Table
  * A User table
  * A Cart Table
* OAuth and passport.js for authentication (Outlook)
